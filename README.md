> Hydbrid or server output targets will need additional configuration for Vercel deployment. Read more [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/).

## Caveats

- Asset management using Cloudinary does not work in dev environment as serverless function to handle media interactions is not available.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cloudinary/
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ [...media].js
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ tina/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

The `tina` directory contains files related to TinaCMS. The TinaCMS documentation for Astro integration can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/frameworks/astro/)

Vercel serverless function required to authenticate the Cloudinary media interactions is added in `api/` directory. Refer [Tina docs](https://tina.io/docs/reference/media/external/cloudinary/) for more details.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                                         |
